## ðŸ§ª Tools & Concepts Covered
- **Python Sockets:** Basic TCP client-server communication
- **Scapy:** Crafting and sending ICMP packets (ping)
- **Base64 Decoding:** Simple encoding challenge solved in Python
- **Linux CLI:** Basic navigation, system commands, and package handling on Kali Linux

## ðŸš€ How to Run
Ensure you have Python 3 and necessary libraries installed.
```bash
pip install scapy
```

Then execute any script, for example:
```bash
python tcp_server.py
python tcp_client.py
```

Or run the entire interactive experience inside Jupyter:
```bash
jupyter notebook Week1_Notebook.ipynb
```
